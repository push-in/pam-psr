**Compatibility package: use [PAM HTTP PSR](https://github.com/push-in/pam-http-psr) (`pushinbr/pam-http-psr`).**<br>
This name stays installable so older Composer projects keep resolving. Do not use it in new applications.

<a id="install"></a>
## <picture><img src=".github/assets/icons/terminal.svg" width="22" height="22" alt=""></picture> Install

Inside a PAM project, require the maintained package instead:

```sh
pam composer require pushinbr/pam-http-psr
```

[PAM HTTP PSR](https://github.com/push-in/pam-http-psr) has the active documentation, API examples, releases, issue tracker and production guidance. Requiring this package installs `pushinbr/pam-http-psr` `^1.0` (see `composer.json`).

<a id="migrate"></a>
## <picture><img src=".github/assets/icons/terminal.svg" width="22" height="22" alt=""></picture> Migrate an existing project

Commit your current `composer.json` and `composer.lock`, then run:

```sh
pam composer remove pushinbr/pam-psr
pam composer require pushinbr/pam-http-psr
pam doctor
```

Run the application test suite before committing the new lockfile. Composer may continue to resolve this package transitively during a staged migration; application code should target the replacement package directly.

<a id="why"></a>
## <picture><img src=".github/assets/icons/sparkle.svg" width="22" height="22" alt=""></picture> Why the name changed

PSR-7/15/17 adaptation belongs to the HTTP product, not to the small PAM runtime.

<a id="support-policy"></a>
## <picture><img src=".github/assets/icons/shield.svg" width="22" height="22" alt=""></picture> Support policy

- No new features are added here.
- Security or resolution fixes may be published only to preserve migration safety.
- New documentation and issues belong to [PAM HTTP PSR](https://github.com/push-in/pam-http-psr).
- The package is marked abandoned on Packagist in favor of `pushinbr/pam-http-psr`.

This explicit compatibility repository is intentional: old installs remain understandable without making the current PAM ecosystem ambiguous.

PAM runs PHP natively on servers, desktops and phones. This repository only keeps an old package name resolvable.
